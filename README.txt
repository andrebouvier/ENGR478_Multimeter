The project was implemented using STM32CubeIDE, and the multimeterFinal is a project folder for STM32CubeIDE.

Inside the Important Files folder, I have put the main.c, as well as other relevant source files that were used in the project.
The header files, and other source files are still included in the multimeterFinal folder, but I just added another folder for
easier access to different source files.

Notably, the systick handler is in the "stm32l4xx_it.c" file as well.
